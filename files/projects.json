    "description": "In Fall of 2017, I was the Artificial Intelligence Project Lead for Upsilon Pi Epsilon's SparkDev program. The project consisted of predicting the trajectory paths of hurricanes using a recurrent neural network (RNN). I lead a group of six students to complete this project in nine weeks using Python and Keras API.</p><p>Upon completion of the project, I decided to pursue this as an independent research project. With the ever-evolving field of artificial intelligence and the sporadic behavior of hurricane trajectories, we utilized a fine grid along with a recurrent neural network to learn the nonlinear response of hurricane trajectories. As first author, I was able to present at a seminar for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) National Hurricane Center (NHC). Following positive feedback from the NOAA scientists, we successfully published <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02548'>\"Predicting Hurricane Trajectories using a Recurrent Neural Network\"</a> to the <a href='https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-19/'>2019 Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)</a> conference under the applied artificial intelligence track to introduce deep learning as a way to enhance the environmental forecasting techniques employed by NHC for more accurate predictions.",
